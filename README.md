## Age Prediction

Machine learning model built with Python to predict age based off a given dataset. Using a CNN (Convolution neural network) to be able to use image processing AI that uses deep learning while also creating multiple models to get an ideal model; creating one without transfer learning, one with transfer learning, and one using a check pointer to save the best model with the best weight.
